Univ. of Florida -- EEL 5632 -- Smart Parking App

## About
This project was part of my graduate-level coursework titled **_Safety and Security of Vehicular Systems_** in the spring of 2023.

The goal of this project was to develop a Smart Parking application to solve a problem facing today's society in a secure way.

The project leveraged a Flutter mobile application (developed by another groupmate) with a Flask-based backend that communicated with the
Google Firebase Real-Time Database platform.

## Contributions

Everything written in this repository was written by me, with the exception of boilerplate provided by connecting to the Firebase ecosystem and pre-built Docker
containers for communicating with the Google Cloud Platform, where this was hosted.
